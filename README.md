tshirtman vim config
===

this config uses vundle

Run ./init after cloning:

* it clones vundle in the bundle directory

* it will try to link ~/.vimrc to the vimrc file here, wich will fail if you
already have a .vimrc, in which case, do the merge yourself

* it should install required packages if you are on a debian based system (will
ask your password if needed)

* it will call vim and tell it to call bundles
