tshirtman vim config
===

run ./init after cloning

it will try to link ~/.vimrc to the vimrc file here, wich will fail if you
already have a .vimrc, in which case, do the merge yourself

it should update submodules

it should install required packages if you are on a debian based system (will
ask your password if needed)
